        The great kingdoms of the past fell long ago, leaving the world of men
        in a dark age of ignorance and superstition. The ancient evils were
        swept from the land with the old empires, but in recent years dim
        figures have crept from the shadows. After millennia of relative peace,
        darkness grows in Edda once again.
