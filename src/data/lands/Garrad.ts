    too.`,

        `Unterlund is an expansive nation that covers the central region of Edda.
        Unterlund is prosperous by the standards of the era and Hidroth is
        unquestionably the most cosmopolitan city west of Ithra. Many of the
        trade routes from across the continent end in the markets of Hidroth.
        Though most of Edda is wild land, in relative terms, the region of
        Unterlund surrounding Hidroth is densely populated.`,

        `Situated at the mouth of the Ragus River, <strong>Hidroth</strong> is
        the capital city of Unterlund. It is an ancient city that has been
        continuously occupied for as long as men have kept written records.
        Immediately preceding the Great War, the kingdoms of men were unified
        and Hidroth served as the de facto capital for all humanity.`,

      paragraphs: [
        `Unterlund was ruled by Ostran clans for much of the Second Age. It was a
        smaller nation than it is now, with Jutlund to the north and Andor to
        the southwest. The Ostrans engaged in internecine warfare for centuries,
        the stories of their countless battles now lost to history. But while
        the north battled, the Andorans emerged as a unified power. Though Andor
        was a much smaller nation than Unterlund, their disciplined and
        well-trained fighting force rapidly swept through Unterlund during the
        9th century TA, eventually laying claim to the Untish throne and
        unifying the two nations. Many of the current lords of Unterlund trace
        their roots back to the first days of that conquest. Though the
        distinctions are less pronounced that they once were, today, the Andoran
        ruling class remain somewhat distinct in culture and appearance from
        their Ostran subjects.`,

    {
      title: 'Culture',
      paragraphs: [
        `The people that inhabit Unterlund today are descendants of the Ostrans
        and Andorans alike. The Andoran nobility tend to be pious, studious, and
        law-abiding, placing great importance on duty to the community. The
        Ostrans are northmen at heart, and as such, are known for their
        commitment to family, their fiery tempers, and their love of drink and
        song. Today, most Untish are farmers, but they have traditions of
        hunting and foraging that date back millennia.`,
        `Halflings have always been a welcome part of Unterlund's culture and are
        considered nearly equal participants in society, with the exception that
        they cannot hold noble title.`,

      paragraphs: [
        `Almost all Untish people worship Cerrunos and the state only sanctions
        religious activities and holidays in his name. There are some remote
        regions where aspects of Ostran culture has held out and Othar is
        worshipped, but they are on the farther fringes of the empire. Hidroth
        is the center of religious life in Unterlund, as it is home to the
        primary religious sects, including the state religion, the Church of the
        Middle Path. Many of Unterlunds religious orders are evangelical and it
        is not uncommon to find missionaries preaching the glory of Cerrunos in
        far-flung reaches of Edda.`,
