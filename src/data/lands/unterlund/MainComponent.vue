      Unterlund is an expansive nation that covers the central region of Edda.
      Unterlund is prosperous by the standards of the era and Hydroth is
      unquestionably the most cosmopolitan city west of Ithra. Many of the trade
      routes from across the continent end in the markets of Hydroth. Though
      most of Edda is wild land, in relative terms, the region of Unterlund
      surrounding Hydroth is densely populated.

      Capital

    <v-card-text>
      Situated at the mouth of the Ragus River, <strong>Hydroth</strong> is the
      capital city of Unterlund. It is an ancient city that has been
      continuously occupied for as long as men have kept written records.
      Immediately preceding the Great War, the kingdoms of men were unified and
      Hydroth served as the de facto capital for all humanity.

      Around Hydroth, the Red Legion serve both law enforcement and paramilitary
      roles as the king's personal guard. Outside of the capital, law is largely
      the responsibility of town guards and councils.

      History
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>
      Unterlund was ruled by Ostran clans for much of the Second Age. It was a
      smaller nation than it is now, with Jutlund to the north and Andor to the
      southwest. The Ostrans engaged in internecine warfare for centuries, the
      stories of their countless battles now lost to history. But while the
      north battled, the Andorans emerged as a unified power. Though Andor was a
      much smaller nation than Unterlund, their disciplined and well-trained
      fighting force rapidly swept through Unterlund near the end of the Second
      Age, eventually laying claim to the Untish throne and unifying the two
      nations. Many of the current lords of Unterlund trace their roots back to
      the first days of that conquest. Though the distinctions are less
      pronounced that they once were, today, the Andoran ruling class remain
      somewhat distinct in culture and appearance from their Ostran subjects.

      Culture
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>
      The people that inhabit Unterlund today are descendants of the Ostrans and
      Andorans alike. The Andoran nobility tend to be pious, studious, and
      law-abiding, placing great importance on duty to the community. The
      Ostrans are northmen at heart, and as such, are known for their commitment
      to family, their fiery tempers, and their love of drink and song. Today,
      most Untish are farmers, but they have traditions of hunting and foraging
      that date back millennia.

      Halflings have always been a welcome part of Unterlund's culture and are
      considered nearly equal participants in society, with the exception that
      they cannot hold noble title.

      Religion
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>
      Almost all Untish people worship Cerrunos and the state only sanctions
      religious activities and holidays in his name. There are some remote
      regions where aspects of Ostran culture has held out and Othar is
      worshipped, but they are on the farther fringes of the empire. Hydroth is
      the center of religious life in Unterlund, as it is home to the primary
      religious sects, including the state religion, the Church of the Middle
      Path. Many of Unterlunds religious orders are evangelical and it is not
      uncommon to find missionaries preaching the glory of Cerrunos in far-flung
      reaches of Edda.
