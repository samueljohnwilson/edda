      paragraphs: [
        `Hetheskein is the domain of the dwarves and they have been its sole
        inhabitants since the Second Age. It takes its name from Hethe, the
        enormous volcanic mountain that dominates the landscape; the great
        majority of the dwarven population lives within the mountain and the
        capital city, Hethedun, sits at its peak. Apart from the population
        within Hethe, the mountain dwarves also maintain outposts in other
        mountains across Hetheskein.`,
        `The dwarves that inhabit the tundra and valleys are distinct from those
        that dwell in Hethe; they are a loose confederation of tribes, bound
        together by their common religious heritage. They are nomadic, with no
        cities to speak of. They maintain civil, if occasionally tense,
        relations with their mountain dwarf kin.`,

      title: 'Capital',
      paragraphs: [
        `<strong>Hethedun</strong> is a citadel that houses the throne of the
        dwarf king. It is the political, cultural, and economic capital of the
        mountain kingdom. The dwarven religion venerates Othar and his worship
        centres around a great forge that is housed here.`,

      title: 'Government and Law Enforcement',
      paragraphs: [
        `In Hethe, the law is enforced by the Ironskins, the military arm of the
        Otharic religious order. However, the rigid morality of mountain dwarf
        society means that there is rarely a need for the Ironskins to exercise
        their authority, so their day-to-day role is primarily ceremonial.`,
        `In the tundra, each tribe has their own way of dealing with criminals,
        though in broad terms, their view of law is based on honour and
        eye-for-an-eye retributive justice.`,

        `Following the diaspora of the Illyum, the uruk made their landing in the
        land that would become Bjordlund. They sought out shelter in the
        Blackspine Mountains and then began to venture further north into what
        would be Hetheskein. At the beginning of the Second Age, when Eos
        created the other races, she awakened the dwarves in the caverns of
        Mount Hethe. Before long, the races came into conflict, and a deep
        hatred would grow between the uruk and the dwarves over the millennia.
        When the War of All Lands finally came to pass, the uruk and dwarves
        fought some of the bloodiest battles of the war. Even to this day,
        across the icy tundra or high in the mountains, it is not unheard of to
        find remains of the ancient battles, mummified by the frigid climate of
        the north. At the end of the war, the uruk were driven out of Hetheskein
        once and for all, as the forces of righteousness prevailed across the
        land. Since then, the dwarves have held sole claim to all of Hetheskein.`,
