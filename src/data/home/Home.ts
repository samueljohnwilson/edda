  quote: `The great kingdoms of the past fell long ago, leaving the world of men
  in a dark age of ignorance and superstition. The ancient evils were
  swept from the land with the old empires, but in recent years dim
  figures have crept from the shadows.<br><br>
  After millennia of relative peace, darkness grows in Edda once again.
  For those who would stand against it, herein lies all that is known.`,
