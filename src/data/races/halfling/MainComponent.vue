      Overview
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>
      The halflings have lived in the midst of the kingdoms of men throughout
      recorded history. In the country, the <strong>fieldfolk</strong> tend to
      live in separate communities, though often directly neighbouring human
      settlements. In the city, the <strong>cityfolk</strong> either manage in
      an oversized world or carve out their own small neighbourhoods, which are
      better equipped to accommodate their diminutive size.

      Unterlund is home to the vast majority of the halfling population, though
      they do live in the other nations of Balamyn; a few have even ventured so
      far as southern Ostramyn, but the cold does not suit their tastes, nor
      their proclivity for going about without shoes.

      Culture

    <v-card-text>
      The <strong>fieldfolk</strong> are known as simple and good-hearted
      people, if a little naive. Most of them are content to tend their gardens,
      smoke their pipe-weed, and while away their days in peace and quiet.
      However, in times of trouble, they have proven themselves to be brave and
      loyal citizens of the kingdoms in which they dwell. There are few men that
      have spent time among the fieldfolk and come away with a harsh word on
      their lips.

      In many cases, the <strong>cityfolk</strong> have inhabited the cities
      they call home for many generations. They have cultures that reflect the
      human society around them, while still retaining some of the
      characteristics and heritage of their halfling roots. In order to provide
      value to the human societies they inhabit, they have learned to embrace
      certain roles, including merchants, moneylenders, librarians, scholars,
      and jurists. Through their long lives and strong familial connections,
      they have a tendency to possess greater education and material wealth than
      many of the humans the live alongside. This can occasionally lead to
      unfortunate resentments or stereotypes being attributed to cityfolk, but
      overall, they are well-regarded and accepted members of society.

      Religion
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>
      Most halflings worship Cerrunos, though they worship Eos in Amin. They
      tend not to be overtly religious and there are no prominent halfling
      religious orders, though particularly pious individuals have been known to
      join human orders.
