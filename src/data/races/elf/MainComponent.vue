      Overview

      The elves retired from the world following the Great War. Today, they
      remain secluded in Neywyll, awaiting a day when they might return to their
      ancient home in Ulwyll. The elves no longer maintain relationships with
      the kingdoms of men and few men have ventured into Neywyll in the
      centuries that have passed since the war; it is unclear as to whether
      those few were welcomed.

      The elves are a noble and thoughtful race, valuing wisdom above all other
      traits. They live in balance with nature and are deeply attuned to its
      cycles. They reside among the trees of Neywyll, rather than clearing them
      to make cities. Their society is relatively egalitarian, but major matters
      are decided by a council of elders. Magic is more common among the elves
      than the other races of Edda, though mostly in the form of cantrips, as
      powerful users remain few and far between.

      Unlike the other races, the elves have full knowledge of the role of
      Enoreth and since arriving in Edda they have remember it in their prayers,
      asking forgiveness for the sins that cast them out from Ulwyll.
