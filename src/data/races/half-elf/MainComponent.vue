      Overview

      During the latter part of the Second Age, the men of Wydmyn formed close
      ties to the elves of Neywyll. The human race was still new to the world
      then and the elves took great pleasure in their companionship. Through
      their close relations with the elves, the men of Wydmyn gained knowledge
      and wealth far greater than other men could imagine. Eventually, some were
      even welcomed into the ancient elven houses. When the Great War descended
      upon Edda, the men of Wydmyn fought valiantly alongside their elven
      brethren; however, some among their ranks would be corrupted by the
      darkness.

      It was at the Battle of Twelve Kings that the elves were betrayed by some
      men of Wydmyn; they suffered greater losses there than in all of the war's
      other battles combined. At the war's end, the elves made the choice to
      retire from the world. The Council ruled that no men could reside in
      Neywyll any longer, and all those of mixed blood were expelled, tearing
      apart families.

      Among the half-elven, there were some who resented the elves for their
      expulsion. They would return to live among humanity, and their elvish
      lineage faded with each passing generation. However, most chose to remain
      among the mountains of Wydmyn just beyond the border of Neywyll. To atone
      for the failings of their forefathers, they serve as the guardians of the
      passage to Neywyll, ensuring the elves are not troubled by the
      encroachment of human civilization.

      The half-elves are few in number and there are even fewer permanent towns
      in Wydmyn. Most are nomads and they strive to maintain a connection to the
      land, living off the land and patrolling their lands to keep outsiders
      from reaching the lands of Neywyll beyond.

      The half-elves of Wydmyn are blessed with the elvish insight into the
      nature of Enoreth. Most of those that dwell among humanity have come to
      worship the Ishtar as humans do.
