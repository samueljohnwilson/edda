      Othar is known as the Oldfather, as he was the first to offer knowledge to
      the Children of Eos. He schooled them in the ways of hunting and
      self-reliance, allowing them to fend for themselves in a cruel world.
      However, he also taught them the ways of war, and great blooshed was
      inflicted in his name.
