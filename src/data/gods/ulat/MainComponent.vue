      Eth-Korel is seen as the agent of death in Edda. It is said that upon a
      mortalâ€™s death, their soul enters the Ethereal plane, beginning their
      eternal journey. But the Spider Queen weaves her web, laying wait for
      those with evil in their hearts. The lucky souls that pass her by will
      enter into Eya, while those wretched that do not are condemned to torture
      in Mora.

      Among mortals, Eth-Korel is mentioned more frequently than the other
      Malor, for she represents the ever-present reality of death in most
      cultures.
