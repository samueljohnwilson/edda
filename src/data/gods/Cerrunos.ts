        `Cerrunos and his brother, Ulat, were the second of the Urdor to be
        brought forth. He resides in Eya alongside the other two Eyar, Othar
        and Eos.`,
        `When Othar began to populate the world with humanoid creations,
        Cerrunos offered them his knowledge, acting as a civilizing force
        for the denizens of Edda. For a time, he walked among the first men,
        serving as a guide and leader. For this reason, he is remembered
        among humans as The First King.`,
        `Cerrunos is rarely roused to anger, but the justice he metes out can
        be perceived as brutal. His devotees are known for their
        dispassionate nature and adherence to law.`,
