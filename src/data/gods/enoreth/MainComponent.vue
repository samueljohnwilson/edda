      In the beginning, there was only
      <strong>Enoreth, the Sum of All Things</strong>. To fill the world with
      life, Enoreth separated three parts from itself; each part was then split
      in two.

      From the first part were born Othar, The Allfather, and Malak, The
      Devourer. From the second part came Cerunnos, The Arbiter, and Ulat Banor,
      The Maelstrom. From the last came Eos, The Dawnbringer, and Eth Korel, The
      Duskfall. Separately, the benevolent powers are known as the Eiar, and the
      malevolent as the Malor. Together, they are the Urdor. The balance of
      their constructive and destructive forces allowed for the cycles of nature
      and the existence of life.
