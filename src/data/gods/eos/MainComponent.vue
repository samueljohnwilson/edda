      Eos is the only of the Urdor blessed with the ability to create new life
      on the material plane, and she used this power to create all of the
      sentient races that exist in Edda, with the exception of the elves and
      orcs. The elves refer to these other races as the Children of Eos.

      Eos is revered as the patron of higher virtues. As a result, she is often
      worshipped by cultures that have embraced high-minded pursuits and turned
      away from the barbarism of war.

      In addition to her mortal worshippers in Edda, Eos presides over the fey
      of Eya in her role as Summer Queen.
