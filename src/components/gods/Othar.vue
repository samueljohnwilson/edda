            Overview

          <v-card-text>
            Othar and his brother, Malak, were the first of the Urdor to be
            formed. He resides in Eya alongside the other two Eyar, Cerrunos and
            Eos.

            Othar is the only of the Urdor blessed with the ability to create
            new life on the material plane, and he used this power to create all
            of the sentient races that exist in Edda, with the exception of the
            elves and orcs. The elves refer to these other races as the Children
            of Eos.

            He is often worshipped by societies that favor wisdom, valor, and
            honor.
