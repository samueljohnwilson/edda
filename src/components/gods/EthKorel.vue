            Overview

          <v-card-text>
            Eth-Korel, and her sister, Eos, were the last of the Urdor to be
            formed. She resides in Mora alongside the other two Malor, Ulat and
            Malak.

            Eth-Korel is seen as the agent of death in Edda. It is said that
            upon a mortalâ€™s death, their soul enters the Ethereal plane,
            beginning their eternal journey. But the Spider Queen weaves her
            web, laying wait for those with evil in their hearts. The lucky
            souls that pass her by will enter into Eya, while those wretched
            that do not are condemned to torture in Mora.

            Among mortals, Eth-Korel is mentioned more frequently than the other
            Malor, for she represents the ever-present reality of death in most
            cultures.
