        Ithra was once the most powerful and wealthy nation in Edda, but all
        that now remains of the former empire is the city-state of Amin. Ithra
        has two distinct regions: the Qadish desert that stretches east from the
        border with Garrad across the peninsula, and a strip of tropical
        rainforest running along the coast known as the Rajapun.

        Capital
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The city-state of <strong>Amin</strong> is all that remains of Ithra. It
        is situated on the tip of the Qadish Peninsula. Few travellers visit the
        isolated city by land, but the Aminites maintain trade relationships
        with Unterlund and Garrad by ship. Amin was a wealthy and cosmopolitan
        city before the war, and its population and diversity was only bolstered
        by refugees from the rest of Ithra. Today, the bustling markets and vast
        libraries of Amin are renowned across Edda.

        Government and Law Enforcement
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The body that governs Amin is known as the Ku'rash. It is composed of
        151 representatives from across the city. While the positions are
        elected democratically, most of those that hold them are exceptionally
        wealthy and influential, making them likely to remain in power once
        elected.
      </v-card-text>
      <v-card-text>
        The law enforcement arm of the Ku'rash are known as the Tomesguard.
        Appointment to the guard is for life and it is a highly sought after
        position, especially for young men from the slums. Once a year, the
        Ku'rash hold a week-long festival of gladiatorial battles to fill
        vacancies among the Tomesguard.

        History
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        In the past, the Qadish desert was dotted with city-states similar to
        Amin, but they fell during the War of All Lands and were never
        re-established. Now, the region is only sparsely populated with small
        tribes of nomads, with the exception of Amin. The ruins of the great
        cities are largely covered by the dunes and forgotten, but there are
        some that speak of ancient wealth and treasures buried deep within the
        red sand.

        Before the war, the dense jungle of Rajapun was also home to a thriving
        network of city-states. However, they refused the call to face the
        forces of darkness head on, choosing instead to fortify their cities and
        wait for the Malor to march against them. However, while they awaited
        the coming darkness, a great sickness swept the land. Known at the
        Plague of Akura, the illness affected the minds of those it afflicted,
        causing them to fall into madness before eventually succumbing to death.
        The plague brought the nation to collapse from within without the dark
        lords ever waging war upon it. The jungle has now reclaimed the ancient
        cities, and it is believed that men no longer dwell in Rajapun. Those
        adventurous souls that have sought out the ancient cities are rarely
        heard from again; those few that have returned are not the same as when
        they set out.

        Culture
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The people of Amin are very cultured compared to the rest of the world.
        They are much more likely to be literate than people in other parts of
        the world and the use of magic, though still rare, is not viewed with
        suspicion and fear, but interest and wonder. The culture is largely
        based on trade with other nations and Ithrans are likely to drive a hard
        bargain as a result. The largest ethnic group in the city is the Ayman,
        but the city is exceptionally diverse and home to ethnicities from all
        over Edda.

        Religion
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The state religion is devoted to Eos, where she is recognized as patron
        of knowledge, and she is worshipped by many in the city. However, there
        are sects devoted to each of the Ishtar in Amin, and in the darker
        corners of the city, likely even cults devoted to the Malor.
