            Eos and her sister, Gorel, were the last of the Urdor to be formed.
            She resides in Eya alongside the other two Ishtar, Othar and
            Cerrunos.

            She is a loving and compassionate being. In addition to her mortal
            worshippers in Edda, Eos presides over the fey of Eya in her role as
            Summer Queen.

            Eos is revered as the patron of higher virtues. As a result, she is
            often worshipped by cultures that have embraced high-minded pursuits
            and turned away from the barbarism of war.
