            Overview
          </v-card-title>
          <v-card-text>
            Eos and her sister, Gorel, were the last of the Urdor to be formed.
            She resides in Eya alongside the other two Ishtar, Othar and
            Cerrunos. Eos is the only of the Urdor blessed with the ability to
            create new life on the material plane, and she used this power to
            create all of the sentient races that exist in Edda, with the
            exception of the elves and orcs. The elves refer to these other
            races as the Children of Eos.

            She is a loving and compassionate being, though mercurial and prone
            to bouts of anger. In addition to her mortal worshippers in Edda,
            Eos presides over the fey of Eya in her role as Summer Queen.
