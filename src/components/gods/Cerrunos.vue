            Overview

          <v-card-text>
            Cerrunos and his brother, Ulat, were the second of the Urdor to be
            brought forth. He resides in Eya alongside the other two Eyar, Othar
            and Eos.

            When Othar began to populate the world with humanoid creations,
            Cerrunos offered them his knowledge, acting as a civilizing force
            for the denizens of Edda. For a time, he walked among the first men,
            serving as a guide and leader. For this reason, he is remembered
            among humans as The First King.

            Cerrunos is rarely roused to anger, but the justice he metes out can
            be perceived as brutal. His devotees are known for their
            dispassionate nature and adherence to law.
