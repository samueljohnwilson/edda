          "The jotünn were the first creations of Othar, hewn from ancient
          stones and imbued with the breath of life. There are races among them,
          and they differ in demeanor, size, and intellect, but all wield
          greater strength than 10 men combined."

        Overview
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The jotünn are the eldest race, apart from the Illyum. There are three
        ancient tribes, each a race in its own right: the
        <strong>Bulgor (hill giants)</strong>, the
        <strong>Fyndor (frost giants)</strong>, and the
        <strong>Vodor (stone giants)</strong>. It is said that the progenitors
        of each tribe were carved from the earth and brought to life by the will
        of Othar.

        The tribes of jotünn maintain broad territories that were defined in the
        distant past. The Bulgor inhabit grasslands, forests, and foothills in
        central Edda. The Fyndor live in the far north, from open tundra to
        mountain peaks. The Vodor dwell in the east, in both jungles and
        deserts.

        Though most humanoids consider jotünn to be evil in nature, the reality
        is more complicated than that. Bulgor are the most violence prone, in
        large part due to their limited intellect. However, Fyndor and Vodor are
        at least as intelligent as humans, and have behavioural complexity to
        match. The Vodor are particularly noted as wise and temperant. While the
        Fyndor do have a great deal of conflict with humans and dwarves in the
        north, this is more the result of ancient animosities more than the
        inherent evil of the Fyndor.
