        Garrad is a vast expanse of rolling grassy plains, scrubland, and
        desert. The Dal people are by far the largest ethnic group. They are
        primarily nomads, traveling across the plains, hunting the great herds
        that thunder across the landscape. Dal men and women alike are trained
        on horses from the moment they take their first steps. Today, they
        dominate nearly all of Garrad, though in the far east, near the border
        with Ithra, the Yenta and Jada peoples have carved out a quiet life of
        pious contemplation.

        Capital
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        One of the only cities in this land of nomads. The Walled City of
        <strong>Kudah</strong>
        was built centuries ago by Ur Kud, a warchief that became the first king
        to unify Garrad under a single banner. Garradi were once fond of the
        phrase, “Weak men build walls”; Kudah’s fortifications proved an
        exception, as Ur Kud ruled until the age of 81, something unheard of
        among warchiefs at the time. He was believed to have fathered hundreds
        of children with his many wives and concubines, making Kud one of the
        most common surnames in the country to this day. Some Garradi from
        outside the capital still use the aforementioned phrase derisively to
        speak of the inhabitants of the city, believing them to have grown soft.
        However, by the standards of most of the nations of Edda, Kudah is a
        brutal and violent city. Slavery is commonplace and gladiatorial battles
        are the primary source of entertainment.

        Law Enforcement
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        Garradi typically settle matters by the logic of might makes right, and
        duels are common. However, theft and sleeping with a man's wife are both
        likely to be dealt with by mob justice. In Kudah, the king's clan serves
        as de facto law enforcement, though their primary purpose is to maintain
        power and enforce order, not to uphold any particular laws.

        History
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The people of Garrad are wild today, and were wilder in the past. Though
        they are as likely to kill one another as they are to kill a foreigner,
        they have never been occupied by an outside force. The Dal have
        dominated this part of the world for as long as anyone can remember,
        though the Yenta and Jada have been gradually pushed ever further east
        over the course of many centuries.

        Culture
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The Dal dominate Garradi culture so much as for them to be one and the
        same, and Dal culture is entirely centered on horses. The Dal not only
        ride horses, but eat their flesh, and drink their milk. In fact, the
        favoured drink of Garradi is an alcoholic beverage made of fermented
        horse milk and a small amount of horse blood. The Dal have never farmed,
        instead sustaining themselves entirely on hunting and horse products.

      <v-card-text>
        The nation of Garrad is essentially a loose confederation of family
        clans. Most Garradi outside of Kudah care far more about their familial
        and ethnic affiliations than they do about the the political entity that
        is the nation.

        The cultures of the Yenta and Jada people are in stark contrast to the
        Dal: they are quiet, pious, eat no meat, and are devoted pacifists. They
        once resided in the desert of the East, but were gradually pushed out by
        the Dal. They now reside in the Copper Mountains, and they are famed for
        the ornate hanging gardens they have carved into the mountainsides.

        Religion
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The Dal are not particularly religious, but will make prayers to Othar
        on special occasions such as weddings and funerals. They are much more
        likely to talk about luck or superstition than divine law.
      </v-card-text>
      <v-card-text>
        The Yenta and Jada are intensely pious peoples, though they do not
        worship any of the Urdor directly. Instead, they spend their time
        seeking spiritual truth through philosophical discussion.
