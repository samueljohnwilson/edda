          "When the elves first came to Edda, the races of men and dwarves had
          not yet awakened. We traveled west, meeting nothing but wild beasts.
          Yet, when we arrived in Neywyll, we came upon the firbolg. Their roots
          here were ancient even then. Though the centuries may pass, we will
          always be visitors in their land."

        Overview
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        To the men of Edda, the elves border on myth; the firbolg have a similar
        reputation among the elves. The mystery surrounding the firbolg is not
        undeserved: they are few in number and lead solitary lives, roaming the
        furthest depths of Neywyll alone, often passing months or years in
        silent contemplation. They live for many centuries and there are some
        alive today that still remember the Second Age. Whatever the firbolg may
        know of their ancient history is not shared with outsiders.

        The firbolg resemble enormous humans with long pointed ears. They have
        grey hair and grey-blue skin. They typically do not cut their hair, nor
        trim their beards.

        Culture
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The firbolg reside in Neywyll and their presence there predates the
        arrival of the elves. They live lives of total solitude and little else
        is known about them.

      <v-card-text>
        The firbolg worship the Old God, whom they call 'Laeth', which means
        'That Which Is' in sylvan.
